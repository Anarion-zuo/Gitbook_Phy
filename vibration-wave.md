$$
\ddot x(t)=-w^2x,w=\frac{k}{m}
$$

The solution is:
$$
x(t)=a\cos wt+b\sin wt
$$
This is the only solution.

Although Hook’s law does not apply everywhere in the universe, for all systems, there is always a Taylor expansion for its potential energy such that:
$$
V(x)=V(0)+xV'(0)+\frac{1}{2}x^2V''(0)+O(x^3)
$$
As $V'(0)=0,V''(0)$:
$$
F(x)=-\frac{d}{dx}V(x)=-V''(0)x+O(x^2)
$$
As $x$ is small enough, the Hook’s law is going to apply everywhere.

The equation of motion $\ddot x+w^2x=0$ has the following properties:

1. $x_{12}(t)=x_1(t)+x_2(t)$ is also a solution.
2. Time translation invariance: $x(t+a)$ is also a solution.

Energy:
$$
V(x)=\frac{1}{2}Kx^2,T(\dot x)=\frac{1}{2}M\dot x^2,H=V+T=\frac{1}{2}Kx^2+\frac{1}{2}M\dot x^2
$$
Plug in time:
$$
H=\frac{1}{2}MA^22_0^2\sin^2(w_0t+\phi)+\frac{1}{2}KA^2\cos^2(w_0t+\phi)=\frac{1}{2}KA^2
$$
